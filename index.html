        <h2>My First Post</h2>
        <p>Yesterday at school we started reading the book Frankenstein written by Mary Shelley published over 200 years ago. So far the story involves this captian of a ship who is sailing with his crew near the arctic where they find a peculiar sight. They find a half frozen to death man on the ice. They eventually nurse him back to life where he then recounts the story of why he was this far north to the captian. This is where the person has a flashback which starts the main story of the book. So far the book is pretty good though I haven't gotten very far and am only on chapter 1.</p>
